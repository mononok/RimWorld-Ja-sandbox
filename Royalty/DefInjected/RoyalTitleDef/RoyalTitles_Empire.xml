  <!-- EN: The Imperial title of baron is the lowest of the middle nobility. While lower titles focus on personal service at war or commerce under a lord, barons hold title as semi-independent rulers. Each baron is subordinate to his liege lord, but his obligations are mostly in supplying wealth and troops, and not in personal service.\n\nIn the Empire, a baron will typically own a city sector, mining colony, or similar outfit. At wartime, a baron may captain a capital ship in name, or control a regiment of troops. -->

  <!-- EN: The Imperial title of esquire is held by individuals at the lowest level of nobility. Esquires are subordinate nobles who mostly do what their liege lord tells them.\n\nIn the Empire, esquires might own a city building or a farm complex. During wartime, an esquire might lead a platoon of troops, captain a frigate, or serve their lord as a specialist or advisor.\n\nTheir low rank makes them paradoxically less useful as diplomats than yeomen. Sending a low-ranked esquire to a negotiation can itself be seen as an insult, whereas a yeoman negotiator is seen as only representing his lord. -->
