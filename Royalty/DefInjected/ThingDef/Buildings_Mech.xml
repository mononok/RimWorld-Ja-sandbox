  <!-- EN: A mechanoid power generation unit. The vanometric power core will run forever, extracting energy from quantum foam fluctuations.\n\nAn internal amplifier system makes it unstable. If damaged, the unit will generate a massive explosion.\n\nSome brave humans steal these from mechanoids for their own use as power plants or defensive bombs. However, an unintentional detonation can be devastating. -->
