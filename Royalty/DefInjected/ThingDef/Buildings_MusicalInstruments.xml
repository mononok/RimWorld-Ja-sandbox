  <!-- EN: A complex stationary musical instrument. A musician touches a row of keys on the front of the instrument. Each key is attached to an internal mechanism which plucks one of a row of strings stretched over a wooden frame. While it permits more complex composition than the harp, its wooden construction and plucking mechanism limit its output volume and expressiveness.\n\nIt can be crafted at an art bench or smithy. -->
